**Description:**
This Kotlin project demonstrates various array operations, including finding the largest element in an array and determining the most frequent element and its frequency.

**Features:**
- Input the size of an array.
- Populate the array with user-defined values.
- Find and display the largest element in the array.
- Determine the most frequent element and its frequency.

**Usage:**
1. Run the program.
2. Enter the size of the array and its elements as prompted.
3. The program will calculate and display the largest element in the array.
4. It will also identify the most frequent element and how many times it appears in the array.

This code serves as a practical example of array manipulation and frequency calculation in Kotlin.
